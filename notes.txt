ABE is the easiest to fly 

Tracy Hilbert is the assistant making all the arrangements.

Arrive on Feb 6 leave on 8

Feb 7


Introduce the new Mac bio lab that uses R, to show what data acquisition, processing, and reporting skills/technology statistics students might be expected to have in their work in other fields.

1. Start with the biology lab
1. An hour with basics of R.
#. Spend a bit of time on Locke^5
#. A bit on big data
#. Covers the first 8 chapters and then ANOVA, then chi^2, then revisiting linear regression.
#. Maybe a little logistic regression, but not necessarily.
#. A bit about R/Markdown

Deliverable: Writing in groups 



## Dec 1, 2014 Phone planning conversation

Elyn and Allison

11 faculty incl 2 computer scientists (who won't come)

Allison is the only formally trained statistician.

Background:

Two 100-level courses: stat methods instead of stat analysis.  Students didn't n

MATH 119 Exploratory data analysis with a bit of inference.  

Book: Moore, McCabe and Craig

Some people have fallen in love with using R.  Elyn is the only of 4 sections not to use R; she uses Minitab

Only half the department even has R running.  

Main question: How to incorporate R into the class?  A lab book for the class with 10 or so projects.
