- Class: text
  Output: We have installed the dataset swim = fetchGoogle("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AnFamthOzwySdHZqZUlqdkM3OU9RZ0hxUDlGTUxiWFE&output=csv")

  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: First type in the commands View(swim) to view the dataset.
  CorrectAnswer: View(swim)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='View(swim)')
  Hint: Use the function View(Name_of_dataset)
 
 
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: If we want to build a subset contains cases only for males, what command should we use? Call it male.
  CorrectAnswer: male = subset(swim, sex=="M")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='male = subset(swim, sex=="M")')
  Hint: Use the subset(Name_of_dataset, category == "Your_answer")


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Build a subset for female too, call it female.
  CorrectAnswer: female = subset(swim, sex=="F")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='female = subset(swim, sex=="F")')
  Hint: Use the subset command
  

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: We have had the subsets male and female. If we want to compare the time between male and female, what command should we use??
  CorrectAnswer: t.test(male$time, female$time); t.test(female$time, male$time) 
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('t.test(male$time, female$time)', 't.test(female$time, male$time)')
  
  
- Class: exact_question
  Output: What is the p-value for time if we compare male and female group? (paste the exact number you got)
  CorrectAnswer: 1.325e-05
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="1.325e-05")
  Hint: Use the command t.test() to get the p-value
  

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the null hypothesis in this case?
  AnswerChoices: The mean swim time of the male group and the female group is the same; The mean swim time of the male group and the female group is significantly different; The mean swim time of the male group is shorter than that of the female group; We cannot give a null hypothesis in this case
  CorrectAnswer: The mean swim time of the male group and the female group is the same
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="The mean swim time of the male group and the female group is the same")
  Hint: The null hypothesis should be the group means are the same.

  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on your p-value in the last question, what should we say about the time between the male and female groups?
  AnswerChoices: We should reject the null and the mean time is significantly different; We should reject the null and the mean time is the same; We cannot reject the null and the mean time is significantly different; We cannot reject the null and the mean time is the same
  CorrectAnswer: We should reject the null and the mean time is significantly different
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="We should reject the null and the mean time is significantly different")
  Hint: If p-value < 0.05, reject the null hypothesis in this case


- Class: mult_question
  Output: Which of the following statements is correct based on the p-value we got?
  AnswerChoices: If we do not reject the null hypothesis, Type I error occurs; If we do not reject the null hypothesis, Type II error occurs; If we reject the null hypothesis, Type I error occurs; If we reject the null hypothesis, Type II error occurs
  CorrectAnswer: If we do not reject the null hypothesis, Type II error occurs
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="If we do not reject the null hypothesis, Type II error occurs")
  Hint: Type II error occurs when you fail to reject H0 but Ha is true. Type I error occurs when you reject H0 but H0 is true.
