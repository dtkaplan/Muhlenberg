- Class: text
  Output: Today, we will practice building linear models and standard curves!

- Class: text
  Output: The data frame that we are using for this activity is called "airpass" and it includes the monthly totals of airline passengers from 1949 to 1951. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let us look at the names of the variables in the data frame. Enter a valid R-command to do this. 
  CorrectAnswer: names(airpass)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(airpass)')
  Hint: Your R-code should look like this --> names(airpass)

- Class: text
  Output: The variable pass measures the number of passengers in thousands and the variable year records the date as a decimal. 
  
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter a valid R-command to view the first six cases of your data frame.
  CorrectAnswer: head(airpass)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(airpass)')
  Hint: Your command should look like this --> head(airpass)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter a valid R-command to find the dimensions (number of cases and variables) of your data frame.
  CorrectAnswer: dim(airpass)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(airpass)')
  Hint: The function is dim(). 


- Class: text
  Output: Consider using the "year" variable to predict the number of flights taken by passengers. In this relationship, year is the explanatory variable and pass is the response variable. 

- Class: text
  Output: Let us make a plot to determine visually the kind of relationship that exists between the two variables of interest. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter a valid R expression to make a scatterplot using ggplot(). Title the graph and label the appropriate axes using the labs() function. 
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(airpass, aes(x=year, y=pass)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Scatter-plot of Passengers vs Year", x="Year", y="Passengers")
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('ggplot'); expr_uses_func('geom_point'); expr_uses_func('labs'); aes_arg('year'); aes_arg('pass')
  Hint: Your R-code should look like this --> ggplot(airpass, aes(x=year, y=pass)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Scatter plot of Passengers vs Year", x="Year", y="Passengers"). Note--> The labels and title can be different!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the above scatter plot you just made, we can see that there is relationship between year and number of passengers. Is the relationship -->
  AnswerChoices: Positive; Negative; No relationship
  CorrectAnswer: Positive 
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Positive")
  Hint: The number of passengers increases with year and it increases at a constant rate. 

- Class: text
  Output: We can add a standard curve to the scatter plot to help us summarize the relationship. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go on! Add a standard curve to your scatter plot. This can be done using the stat_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) function. Remember to change the title as well! 
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(airpass, aes(x=year, y=pass)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Standard Curve of Passengers vs Year", x="Year", y="Passengers")+stat_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('ggplot'); expr_uses_func('geom_point'); expr_uses_func('labs');expr_uses_func('stat_smooth'); aes_arg('year'); aes_arg('pass')
  Hint: Your code should look like this --> ggplot(airpass, aes(x=year, y=pass)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Standard Curve of Passengers vs Year", x="Year", y="Passengers")+stat_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) Note --> Your title and axes labels may differ from mine!
        
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Re-plot the above graph with standard errors this time. All you have to do is change the se=FALSE to se=TRUE in the stat_smooth function. 
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(airpass, aes(x=year, y=pass)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Standard Curve of Passengers vs Year", x="Year", y="Passengers")+stat_smooth(method="lm", se=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('ggplot'); expr_uses_func('geom_point'); expr_uses_func('labs');expr_uses_func('stat_smooth'); aes_arg('year'); aes_arg('pass')
  Hint: Your code should look like this --> ggplot(airpass, aes(x=year, y=pass)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Standard Curve of Passengers vs Year", x="Year", y="Passengers")+stat_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Write a valid R-command to create a linear model that captures the relationship between the date (variable name "year") and number of passengers (variable name "pass"). Name this model model1. 
  CorrectAnswer: model1=lm(pass~year, data=airpass); model1=lm(pass~year, airpass)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('model1=lm(pass~year, data=airpass)', 'model1=lm(pass~year, airpass)')
  Hint: Your code should look like this --> model1=lm(pass~year, data=airpass)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Summarize the linear model you just created using the regressionAnalysis() command. 
  CorrectAnswer: regressionAnalysis(model1)
  AnswerTests: regressionAnalysis(model1)
  Hint: Your code should look like this --> regressionAnalysis(name_of_model)

  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: How could you find the number of passengers in July of 1973? Remember how month is represented in this data frame. For example, July 1973 would be documented as 73.5. 
  AnswerChoices: pass = -1474.771 + 31.886 * 1973; 1973 = -1474.771 + 31.886 * year; pass = -1474.771 + 31.886 * 73.5
  CorrectAnswer: pass = -1474.771 + 31.886 * 73.5
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="pass = pass = -1474.771 + 31.886 * 73.5")
  Hint: Replace the year variable in the equation with 73.5 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the slope of the line of model1? In this example, the units of slope are thousands of passengers per year. 
  AnswerChoices: 1474.771;-1474.771;31.886;-31.886
  CorrectAnswer: 31.886
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="31.886")
  Hint: Look at the coefficient of year in the $Model.Values portion of the regressionAnalysis. 

- Class: exact_question
  Output: What is the R-squared value for model1? (Round your answer to two decimal places).
  CorrectAnswer: 0.85
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="0.85")
  Hint: Look at the $R.squared value in the regressionAnalysis of model1.


- Class: mult_question
  Output: Study the p-value in the regressionAnalysis() summary. Based on the p-value, is there a significant linear relationship between the year and the number of monthly passengers?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Yes")
  Hint: The p-value is almost 0 which is much less than the cut-off value of 0.05.
