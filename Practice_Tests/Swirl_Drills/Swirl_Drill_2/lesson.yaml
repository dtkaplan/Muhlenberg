- Class: text
  Output: Today, we will practice building linear models and standard curves!

- Class: text
  Output: The data frame that we are using for this activity is called "ozone" and it lists the atmospheric Ozone concentration in the Los Angeles Basin in 1976 along with other meteorological data such as humidity, temperature, pressure gradient, visibility and day of the year. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let us look at the names of the variables in the data frame. Enter a valid R-command to do this. 
  CorrectAnswer: names(ozone)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='names(ozone)')
  Hint: Your R-code should look like this --> names(name_of_dataset)

- Class: text
  Output: The two variables that we will use for this activity are "OzoneConc" and "temp". "OzoneConc" measures the ozone concentration in ppm and "temp" records the atmospheric temperature in Farenheit. 
  
  
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter a valid R-command to view the first six cases of your data frame.
  CorrectAnswer: head(ozone)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='head(ozone)')
  Hint: Your command should look like this --> head(name_of_dataset)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter a valid R-command to find the dimensions (number of cases and variables) of your data frame.
  CorrectAnswer: dim(ozone)
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='dim(ozone)')
  Hint: Your command should look like this --> dim(name_of_dataset)


- Class: text
  Output: Consider using the "temp" variable to predict the ozone concentration. In this relationship, temp is the explanatory variable and OzoneConc is the response variable. 

- Class: text
  Output: Let us make a plot to determine visually the kind of relationship that exists between the two variables of interest. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Enter a valid R expression to make a scatter plot using ggplot(). Title the graph and label the appropriate axes using the labs() function. 
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(ozone, aes(x=temp, y=OzoneConc)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Scatter plot of Ozone Concentration by Temperature", x="Temperature(F)", y="Ozone Conc.(ppm)")
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('ggplot'); expr_uses_func('geom_point'); expr_uses_func('labs'); aes_arg('temp'); aes_arg('OzoneConc')
  Hint: Your R-code should look like this--> ggplot(ozone, aes(x=temp, y=OzoneConc)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Scatter-plot of Ozone Concentration by Temperature", x="Temperature(F)", y="Ozone Conc.(ppm)") Note--> The labels and title can be different!

- Class: mult_question
  Output: Based on the above scatter plot you just made, we can see that there is relationship between ozone concentration and the temperature. Is the relationship -->
  AnswerChoices: Positive; Negative; No relationship 
  CorrectAnswer: Positive
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Positive")
  Hint: Ozone concentration increases with increase in temperature, and the increase occurs at a constant rate. 

- Class: text
  Output: We can add a standard curve to the scatter plot to help us summarize the relationship. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Go on! Add a standard curve to your scatter plot. This can be done using the stat_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) function. Remember to change the title as well! 
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(ozone, aes(x=temp, y=OzoneConc)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Standard Curve of Ozone Concentration by Temperature", x="Temperature(F)", y="Ozone Conc.(ppm)") + stat_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('ggplot'); expr_uses_func('geom_point'); expr_uses_func('labs');expr_uses_func('stat_smooth'); aes_arg('temp'); aes_arg('OzoneConc')
  Hint: Your code should look like this --> ggplot(ozone, aes(x=temp, y=OzoneConc)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Standard Curve of Ozone Concentration by Temperature", x="Temperature(F)", y="Ozone Conc.(ppm)") + stat_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE) Note --> Your title and axes labels may differ from mine!
        
- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Re-plot the above graph with standard errors this time. All you have to do is change the se=FALSE to se=TRUE in the stat_smooth function. 
  CorrectAnswer: ggplot(ozone, aes(x=temp, y=OzoneConc)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Standard Curve of Ozone Concentration by Temperature", x="Temperature(F)", y="Ozone Conc.(ppm)") + stat_smooth(method="lm", se=TRUE)
  AnswerTests: expr_uses_func('ggplot'); expr_uses_func('geom_point'); expr_uses_func('labs');expr_uses_func('stat_smooth'); aes_arg('OzoneConc'); aes_arg('temp')
  Hint: Your code should look like this --> ggplot(ozone, aes(x=temp, y=OzoneConc)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Standard Curve of Ozone Concentration by Temperature", x="Temperature(F)", y="Ozone Conc.(ppm)") + stat_smooth(method="lm", se=TRUE)


- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Write a valid R-command to create a linear model that captures the relationship between the Ozone concentration (variable name "OzoneConc") and temperature (variable name "temp"). Name this model model1. 
  CorrectAnswer: model1=lm(OzoneConc~temp, data=ozone); model1=lm(OzoneConc~temp, ozone)
  AnswerTests: any_of_exprs('model1=lm(OzoneConc~temp, data=ozone)', 'model1=lm(OzoneConc~temp, ozone)')
  Hint: Your code should look like this --> model1=lm(OzoneConc~temp, data=ozone)

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Summarize the linear model you just created using the regressionAnalysis() command. 
  CorrectAnswer: regressionAnalysis(model1)
  AnswerTests: regressionAnalysis(model1)
  Hint: Your code should look like this --> regressionAnalysis(name_of_model)

  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: How would you calculate the ozone concentration at a temperature of 75 Farenheit? 
  AnswerChoices: OzoneConc = -14.937 + 0.433 * 75; 75 = -14.937 + 0.433 * temp
  CorrectAnswer: OzoneConc = -14.937 + 0.433 * 75
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="OzoneConc = -14.937 + 0.433 * 75")
  Hint: Replace the temp variable in the equation with 75. 

- Class: mult_question
  Output: What is the slope of the line of model1? In this example, the units of slope are ozone concentration (in ppm) per degree Farenheit. 
  AnswerChoices: -14.97; +14.97; 0.433; -0.433; 0.609; 0
  CorrectAnswer: 0.433
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="0.433")
  Hint: Look at the coefficient of temp in the $Model.Values portion of the regressionAnalysis. 

- Class: exact_question
  Output: How much variability in Ozone concentration is explained by temperature? Write your answer as a percentage but do not include the % sign. (Round your answer to one decimal place).
  CorrectAnswer: 60.9
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="60.9")
  Hint: Look at the $R.squared value in the regressionAnalysis of model1 and multiply it by 100 to get a percentage!


- Class: mult_question
  Output: Study the p-value in the regressionAnalysis() summary. Based on the p-value, is there a significant linear relationship between the Ozone concentration and temperature?
  AnswerChoices: Yes; No
  CorrectAnswer: Yes
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal="Yes")
  Hint: The p-value is almost 0 which is much less than the cut-off value of 0.05.
